This 3rd semester project sets out to design an augmented version of the board game Colosseum, using Computer Vision. Additionally, research is conducted into the area of human perception - specifically, colour blindness. Computer Vision makes use of methods and functions to perform pointand neighborhood processes on live camera footage, to detect objects of interest. A PC application which is able to detect objects in front of a camera is developed using C++ with the openCV library, using this as a cue to roll a digital dice. An auxiliary C application takes this number and displays available moves onto the board of Colosseum. By displaying available moves onto the board the gameplay runs smoother, supporting players in their game.

The Bachelor project deals with detection of mobilizing ICU patients, through the use of C++ and OpenCV library. The goal is by using a thermal camera, classify whether the patient is sitting in a chair, standing, doing exercise (either alone or with the help of a norse) or if they are being repositioned in bed by the nurse. This first iteration of the CV application focuses on detecting whether the patient is out of bed, and either standing/walking or sitting in a chair. The application prints the classification data to a comma separated value file (.cvs). The CV application proved to have high reliability and validity.
